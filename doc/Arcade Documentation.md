# Arcade Documentation

This is a documentation for the EPITECH project called "Arcade" done by Matthieu Veiga, Yoan Saint-Juste and Jérôme EAP in C++.
Our Arcade has 2 games (Nibbler and SolarFox) and 3 graphic libraries (SFML, ncurses and libcaca) implemented.
This documentation will explain how to implement new graphics libraries or game libraries compatible with our system.
